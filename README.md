# Hardhat Boilerplate

# Deprecation notice
On defi-wonderland we have been using foundry for all new projects for quite some time now, therefore maintaining a template to bootstrap new hardhat projects does not make sense for us anymore. 
If you are interested in maintaining this yourself, feel free to fork it and open an issue so we can use this document to direct users to your fork.

## Why ?

Thought to have a fast way of bootstraping projects with best practice's in mind. Having linters, prettiers, standards on how to commit, and changelog creation & maintenance.

---

## How ?

This is achieved using several hardhat plugins, and external known packages.

---

## Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install
# Copy Env example file
cp .env.example .env
```

After installing dependencies and copying the example environment, you will have to update your `.env` file with
at least you alchemy API KEY (`NODE_URI_ETHEREUM`).
<br/>
You can generate your API KEY in the [Alchemy site](https://www.alchemy.com).
